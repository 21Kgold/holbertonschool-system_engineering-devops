Get Apache to run

Start apache, keeping in mind that:
An Apache AH00558: Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name message is generated when Apache is not configured with a global ServerName directive. The message is mainly for informational purposes, and an AH00558 error will not prevent Apache from running correctly.
