0x19. Postmortem

What went right during the project that we should repeat next time?
What went wrong that we should avoid next time?
What didnâ€™t we do this time that we should add to our agenda?

Postmortems ensure that your company runs as efficiently as possible and is always improving. They find wins to take away from projects that seem like failures and find ways to improve on projects that already appeared to be fully optimized.
